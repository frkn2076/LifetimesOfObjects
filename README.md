# LifetimesOfObjects
Singleton, Scoped, Transient

### You can see the different lifetimes of objects (singleton, scoped, transient) by calling get services;

  **- .../singletonCar**
  
  **- .../scopedTruck**
  
  **- .../transientBike**
  
  To be crystal clear, call these services via different controller too :)
